      ### WELLIOVIZ is a JavaScript library that provides functionality to visualize well logs, particularly those already converted to JSON, using the d3.js visualization library.
      Central to wellioviz is the concept that how to plot and what to plot can be put into a JSON template that has sensible defaults, such that the end-user only has to understand what they want to change about the plotting, not the whole d3.js code.

        ### Functions used to get data in. 
        As people are going to bring in data in different formats from different places, there will be mulitiple functions. Multiple functions for different wants to get data in and differently formatted data. Users can use their own functions for this too. 
        If you're going to use LAS 2.0 files and want to convert them JSON, the best way is to use the <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js">wellio.js</a> library. We're also working on a conversion between JSON from <a href="https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio">LASIO.py</a>s to WELLIO.js style JSON. 
    - name: Transformation funtions
      description: |
        Data is reformatted into a form that wellioviz can used.
        #### Transformation functions for data that comes in as Wellio.js style JSON
        - {@link #convertwelljsontoobj} 
        - {@link #fromjsonofwellgetthingsforplotting}
        - {@link #takeinarraysandgetobjectofcurvedataforplotting}
        #### Transformation functions for data that comes in as sparse style JSON
        - {@link #createdeptharray}
    - name: Packaging functions
      description: |
        Sensible defaults in a pre-packaged template that comes with wellioviz are combined with the reformatted data from the transformation step.
        - {@link #multiplelogplot}
    - name: Plotting functions
      description: |
        How the data should be plotted and what data should be plotted is turned into an SVG.
        - {@link #curvebox}
        - {@link #savesvg}
        --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
    - name: Helper Functions
      description: |
        In addition to the 4 main groups of functions above, there are some odds and ends helper functions, mostly for getting templates and examples.
        - {@link #define_wellioviz}
        - {@link #getexampletemplate}
        - {@link #getfakeincomingsparsedataexample}
