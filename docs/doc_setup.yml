      ### WELLIOVIZ is a JavaScript library that provides functionality to visualize well logs, particularly those already converted to JSON, using the d3.js visualization library.
      Central to wellioviz is the concept that how to plot and what to plot can be put into a JSON template that has sensible defaults, such that the end-user only has to understand what they want to change about the plotting, not the whole d3.js code.

        ### Functions used to get data in. 
        Wellioviz assumes people are going to want to bring in data in different formats. It doesn't presuppose one format. Some people will want to load an entire well logs file to JSON and bring that in entirely on the front-end via JavaScript. Others will want to extract only the information needed on the backend and then send just that data to the front-end where it is transformed into a format wellioviz can take. 
        
        If you're going to use LAS 2.0 files and don't mind loading the entire file and then converting it all to JSON on the front-end, the best way to do that is to use the <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js">wellio.js</a> library. We're also working on a conversion between JSON from <a href="https://github.com/kinverarity1/lasio">LASIO.py</a>s to WELLIO.js style JSON. 

        If you're not using wellio.js, getting the data into the front-end for JavaScript is done by functions you write.s
    - name: Transformation funtions
      description: |
        Data is reformatted into a form that wellioviz can used.
        #### Transformation functions for data that comes in as Wellio.js style JSON
        - {@link #convertwelljsontoobj} 
        - {@link #fromjsonofwellgetthingsforplotting}
        - {@link #takeinarraysandgetobjectofcurvedataforplotting}
        #### Transformation functions for data that comes in as sparse style JSON
        - {@link #createdeptharray}
    - name: Packaging functions
      description: |
        Sensible defaults in a pre-packaged template that comes with wellioviz are combined with the reformatted data from the transformation step.
        - {@link #multiplelogplot}
    - name: Plotting functions
      description: |
        How the data should be plotted and what data should be plotted is turned into an SVG.
        - {@link #curvebox}
        - {@link #savesvg}

        In addition to the 4 main groups of functions above, there are some odds and ends helper functions, mostly for getting templates and examples.
        - {@link #define_wellioviz}
        - {@link #getexampletemplate}
        - {@link #getfakeincomingsparsedataexample}
