# Hackathon! 
#### Plans for SWUNG Transform Hackathon 2020

## Three Types of Sprint Issues to Pick From:
### 1. Tiny Issues that will have accompanying walk throughs to show new users how to make that type of change
- Make Changes to Documentation:
    - Improve something in the documentation that you found confusing.
    - Add terminal examples to usuage & install sections of the documentation.
    - Add gallery section with links to additional examples that have,are,will be created.
- Add new variable to plotting template and main plotting function curveBox()  <=== need to write instructions for this!

### 2. Larger more complicating Issues "from the pile"
- Issue boards:
    - Prime Issue Board: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellioviz/projects/1
    - Userfriendliness Issue Board: https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellioviz/projects/2
### 3. Build GUIs for the visualization library
This is more of a full hackathon project. What exists currently is best demonstrated by <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/first-wellio-example-with-all-wellioviz-functions-from-npm">this Observable notebook</a> and this <a href="https://justingosses.github.io/wellioviz/demo.html">barebones demo webpage</a>. What doesn't exist yet is a webpage or Observable notebook where a non-code user can play around with all the style configuration variables in the plotting template to change things like colors, fills, line widths, sizes, etc. You can see an example of what is possible in the Observable notebook where there is a slider to change the dividing line between shale & silt and silt & sand in the gamma-ray log. 

## Things that Need to be Done Before Hackathon
1. More easy issues tagged.
2. Tests started.
3. Example HTML/CS/JS GUI created that goes beyong single path barebones and let's user change some of Wellioviz's options.
