# Hackathon! 
#### Plans for SWUNG Transform Hackathon 2020

## Three Types of Sprint Issues to Pick From:
### 1. Tiny Issues that have accompanying walk throughs to show new users how to make that type of change
### 2. Larger more complicating Issues "from the pile"
### 3. Build GUIs for the visualization library


## Things that Need to be Done Before Hackathon
1. 4 easy issues identified and walk throughs developed.
2. Documentation should be reasonably clean with very good coverage.
3. Tests started.
4. Example HTML/CS/JS GUI created that goes beyong single path barebones and let's user change some of Wellioviz's options.
